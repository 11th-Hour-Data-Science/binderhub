Create your Kubernetes cluster
==============================

BinderHub is built on top of JupyterHub, which uses Kubernetes to manage
user instances in the cloud. The `JupyterHub Kubernetes instructions <https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create-k8s-cluster.html>`_
has instructions on setting up Kubernetes on several cloud providers. We
recommend that you follow these instructions to set up Kubernetes, and then
return to this guide to set up your BinderHub deployment.

Once you've set up Kubernetes, it's time to
`set up some tools on the cluster <setup-cluster-tools.html>`_.
