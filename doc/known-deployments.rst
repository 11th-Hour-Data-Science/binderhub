BinderHub Deployments
=====================

BinderHub is open-source technology that can be deployed anywhere that
Kubernetes is deployed. The Binder community hopes that it will be used
for many applications in research and education. As new organizations adopt
BinderHub, we'll update this page in order to provide inspiration to others
who wish to do so.

If you or your organization has set up a BinderHub that isn't listed here,
please `open an issue <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues>`_ on
our GitHub repository to discuss adding it!
